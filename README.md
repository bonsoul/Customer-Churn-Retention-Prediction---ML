# Customer-Churn-Retention-Prediction---ML
The Customer Churn Prediction project aims to identify customers who are likely to stop using a company’s services or products. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the project analyzes historical customer data—such as demographics, usage patterns, and engagement history—to uncover patterns that signal churn. The model is trained on this data to classify whether a customer is likely to churn or remain loyal.

The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting to predict churn.

This helps the business implement targeted retention strategies, reducing customer loss and improving overall profitability.
